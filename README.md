## React first to last for beginner

Bascially, the `react.js` project I'm teaching my younger brother. He is interested to learn `react.js` for `frontend` development.

How to create `react.js` project?
1) Node js latest version install
2) NPM (Node pakage manager) install 
3) Finally `react` CLI install globally and

### `npm install -g create-react-app`

How to run the project:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in the browser.

If you close the development server you may press ```` control+c ````
